# aemn

    - the tool to level up social interactions

aemn's purpose is to determine common interests between different users.

	1. it creates a profile of each user, based on manually entered information, swiped interests and data from other social media accounts
	2. when users connect with each other in a session, an intersection of their profiles is determined.
	3. based on this intersection, 'triggers' for interactions are offered.

in a world without aemn, most of the surrounding people are strangers; even amongst those considered as acquaintances, only a fraction of who they are is known.

aemn offers the opportunity to change that.

in a world with aemn, a stranger might reveal themselves as your best friend.

there's no need to spend all your precious seconds to talk about the weather or other topics.
no need for awkward silence or anything of that sort.
talk about the things that truly interest you.

enjoy every interaction.
